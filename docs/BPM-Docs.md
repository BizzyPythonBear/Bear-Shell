# BPM
Bear-Package-Manager is a package manager made for bear-shell. It's essentially like every other package manager.

## Usage
```bpm <option> <package>```

## Installation
Installing bpm is very simple. All you have to do is start your shell, (make sure it's up-to-date) and when it tells you that bpm was not found, answer y in the prompt, and it will install. You may have to restart bear-shell after this.
