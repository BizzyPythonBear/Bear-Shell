## Accessing the Framework
If you'd like to access the framework, instead of typing your password in the login page, type 'testing' to be taken to the Testing framework portal. To continue to the full frame, you'll need to enter the command 'test'. Once you've done that, you'll be taken to the full frame. You can then type 'help' to be given all the working commands and flags. <b>(Some flags are limited to certain commands)</b>

## Framework Info
The framework is the frame that holds Bear-Shell together. Soon, it will become the place where you will configure settings like colors, menu, and others. As of right now, its just where I'll test terminal based updates.

## Important Stuff
The framework isn't finished yet, the framework is probably the second biggest part of Bear-Shell, it will take some time to update and mold to an extensible frame for the shell.
